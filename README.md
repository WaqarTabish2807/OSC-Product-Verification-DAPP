**About**
>The product Verification Dapp is a Decentralized Application that
acts as a proof of existence for an external entity such as a book in
a Library or a clothing product which can be tracked across
various branches/stores of a brand.
The product details can be stored on a document which can
contain the unique Product-ID, Bar-code and various other
differentiators and properties. This Dapp can then be used to
store a cryptographic hash of the document containing details of
the product. Users can verify the existence and validity of a
product whose digital hash is stored in a blockchain.
The client side of the Dapp will compute a cryptographic hash
depending on the contents of the document. The time-stamp
along with the document hash is then submitted to the smart
contract associated with the dapp.
The cryptographic hash depends on the document’s contents and
any change to the contents will change the hash and hence will fail
during verification.
